# manipulatingTheDom
Created with CodeSandbox

In this repo, I did the following with JavaScript:
- Transform a List Element & Change a Font Size
- Highlight an H3 Element
- Switch Out an Image

I used querySelector() to select and change DOM objects. I used the innerHTML property to add a span element to style a specific word in a heading. Last but not least, I rounded out my querySelector() by using the src attribute and alt attribute to change an image.
